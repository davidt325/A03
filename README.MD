PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software.

To start off, I have downloaded Webstorm from, https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows

I have also installed Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

After successfully installing Webstorm, I have created a GitHub account on www.github.com/join.

Next it was time to link Webstorm to my GitHub, I pressed Ctrl+Alt+S Selected Version Control, Git, and entered path to 
git.exe.

We click on VSC, create git repository to create a new Repository on GitHub, give it a name, and click OK.

Once the repository was created, it was time to create a project and connect the project to the repository.

I have clicked File, New, Project and gave it a name. Once the project was made, it was time to create the first file.

In the project tab I right-clicked, new, file, named it README.MD, and clicked OK. The file was now created, and I have 
filled the file with information.

Once I was done, I clicked, Git, Commit, made sure the file I wanted to commit was highlighted, wrote a commit message, 
then clicked on commit and push, so that the  file is sent to my GitHub repository, https://github.com/davidt325/A03 .

I have successfully committed this file and everything seems to work perfectly.
